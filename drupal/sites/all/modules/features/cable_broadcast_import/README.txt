All CSV files must be UNICODE encoded

     • Entry must be unique increasing numbers (NID_01, NID_02, NID_03…)
     • Date Start must be in form MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM with the hour adjusted for the current difference between EST/EDT and GMT (+5/6 Hours)
     • Date End must be in form MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM AM/PM with the hour adjusted for the current difference between EST/EDT and GMT (+5/6 Hours)
     • Original Event must be NID of the Event, can be found by going to the event, clicking the Edit button, then noting the ID.  The URL will read nysenate.gov/node/NUMBER/edit.  The Number is the Node ID
     • Live must be either 1 or 0; 1 for Live, 0 for recorded

Once you have your file, note where it is on your desktop, then go to:
www.nysenate.gov/import/cable_broadcast

Choose your file. The first time you choose your file, it will be an import button.  Each subsequent time it will have a file already in there; that is your previous file, you do not want to use that.  Press Choose File and choose your current file.

The ID for Entry must be ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE across ALL imports or it will override previous entries.  

See example.csv for an example file.
